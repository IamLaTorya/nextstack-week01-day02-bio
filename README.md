# NeXTStack — Week 1 Day 2: Bio Page

## What I built
A semantic HTML bio page with sections, lists, links, and an image.

## How to run it
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## What I learned
- Semantic HTML helps structure content clearly.
- File paths must match folder names exactly.

## What was challenging
- No significant challenges came up during this project; the instructions made the process smooth.

## Next improvement
- Add CSS styling in Week 2.
